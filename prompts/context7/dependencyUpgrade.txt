Analyze all project dependencies. For each dependency, 
use Context7 to fetch the most up-to-date and version-specific documentation and 
recommended usage patterns. If a newer compatible version exists, update the dependency version in package.json. 
If the updated version requires different API usage, apply the necessary code changes throughout the project to match
the recommended implementation.
